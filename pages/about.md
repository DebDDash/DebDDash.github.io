# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br> a final-year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur, majoring in Biological Sciences & Bioengineering, and also pursuing a BS in Data Science from IIT Madras. My interests span healthcare, genomics, neuroscience, and machine learning.

Along the way, I’ve explored a mix of research and applied work—digging into EEG analysis, playing with deep learning models, building interfaces, and mentoring teams on interdisciplinary projects. I’ve come to love the process of turning questions into code, and data into insight.

Outside academics, I balance things out with boxing and chess—one keeps me moving, the other keeps me thinking. I’m also a big believer in sharing ideas, learning collaboratively, and building things that make a difference (or at least make people curious).

Feel free to check out my projects or drop a message if you’d like to connect, collaborate—or just chat about cool ideas and challenges!
