# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,
I’m a final-year undergraduate (BTech) at IIT Kanpur, in Biological Sciences & Bioengineering, and I’ve also earned a diploma in Data Science from IIT Madras.

My interests span genomics, finance, neuroscience, healthcare, and machine learning—with a strong focus on translating research into practical applications.

Over the years, I’ve explored a wide range of projects, from brain-computer interfaces and gene expression analysis to stock market prediction and privacy-preserving machine learning. These experiences have helped me think critically, work across disciplines, and stay rooted in curiosity and purpose.

At the Brain and Cognitive Society, I’ve led machine learning initiatives, mentored students, and contributed to projects that bring together neuroscience and data science. I’m driven by ideas that not only challenge the status quo but also help us better understand and improve the world around us.

Outside of academics, I balance things out with boxing and chess—one keeps me moving, the other keeps me focused. I’m always up for sharing ideas, learning collaboratively, and building things that spark curiosity or make a difference.

Feel free to check out my projects or drop me a message if you’d like to connect, collaborate, or just chat about cool ideas and challenges!
